This is python client and server for data collection from a smart chair equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit.

I used these scripts to collect data used in our papers [eSports Pro-Players Behavior During the Game Events: Statistical Analysis of Data Obtained Using the Smart Chair](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9060167/)
and 
[Understanding Cyber Athletes Behaviour Through a Smart Chair: CS:GO and Monolith Team Scenario](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8767295/).
